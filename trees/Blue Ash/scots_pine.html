            Scotch Pine (Pinus sylvestris), an evergreen conifer, is native to northern Europe and northern Asia, from Scotland to Siberia. It has been widely planted and naturalized throughout northeast and midwest North America for centuries. It is commonly found in Ohio, where it is grown in urban areas as an ornamental evergreen tree, in rural areas of poor soil as a tree for erosion control or for primary establishment, or on Christmas tree plantations. It is logged at maturity in Europe as an important timber tree and cut in youth in America as one of the most popular Christmas trees.
