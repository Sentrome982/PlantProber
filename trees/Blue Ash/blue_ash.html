            Blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata), present almost exclusively in the western half of Ohio, is the ash tree that is different in four respects from other ashes found east of the Mississippi River. First, it usually has square, rather than round, young twigs that may be winged or corky. Second, its mature bark is usually scaly and platy, rather than ridged and furrowed. Third, it does not have separate male and female trees, since all of its flowers are "perfect," and therefore every tree can yield fertile seeds under appropriate conditions. Fourth, the pioneers extracted a blue dye from its inner bark, giving it the common name of blue ash. Like green ash and white ash, the high-quality and slightly more dense wood of blue ash is harvested to make tool handles, furniture, and for use as firewood.
